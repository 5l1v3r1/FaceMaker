# FaceMaker

This is just a simple program to create anime character faces. You can adjust all parameters by changing some sliders or select another parental link dependency.

## Hints
To **adjust the position and rotation** of parts, sometimes you have to change the link to match the actual part you are editing, instead of a parent part. Linking means, if you are gonna change the parent part, you will also change all child parts in the same way.
